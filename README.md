The project makes use of Machine Learning techniques to recommend ten restaurants to a user living in Hyderabad, India, based on the input.
It takes input from the user for the following attributes:

> Restaurant Type ( Casual Dining, Cafe, Quick Bites etc.)

> Cuisines (North Indian, Italian, Continental etc.)

> Approximate Cost for two people (Cheap, Affordable, Expensive etc.)

> Location (Multiple locations of Hyderabad like Jubilee Hills, BITS Hyderabad, Secunderabad etc.)

It then applies TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity to find similarity scores for all the restaurants
present in the dataset, i.e. 51,717 spread across the city of Hyderabad.

Then the output is given in the form of the top 10 restaurants with multiple other fields like
>Address

>Online orders available

>Rating (out of 5)

>Dishes liked

The report for the same is made in **CRISP-DM Methodology** and is available in both .docx and .pdf format.
